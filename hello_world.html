    <h2>My favorite quote:</h2>
    <p>If you are part of a society that votes, then do so. There may be no candidates and no measures you want to vote
        for ... but there are certain to be ones you want to vote against. In case of doubt, vote against. By this rule
        you will rarely go wrong. If this is too blind for your taste, consult some well-meaning fool (there is always
        one around) and ask his advice. Then vote the other way. This enables you to be a good citizen (if such is your
        wish) without spending the enormous amount of time on it that truly intelligent exercise of franchise requires.
        - Robert A. Heinlein</p>

    <p>I really don't have a favorite actor, but I do like George Clooney's work.<br>He has a gravitas that tends to
        transcend
